Subject: TBVx model output format
==============================================================================================================
The columns in the [stocks] output generated by a simulation run are as follows:

country	year	VXa	SES	RISK	HIV	TB	age_from	age_thru	value

with:

country		3 letter ISO code of country
year		moment of generating output 
VXa		VXa  state 
SES		SES  state 
RISK		RISK state 
HIV		HIV  state 
TB 		TB   state 
age_from        age from e.g. 0
age_thru        age thru e.g. 14
value           number of people

The columns in the [flows] output generated by a simulation run are as follows:

country	year	VXa	SES	RISK	HIV	TB	dim	subject	flow	age_from	age_thru	value

with (in addition to the stocks ouput):

dim             dimension for output on inflow / outflow (i.e. TB, HIV, Vx, DEM)

subject         TBp for TB progression
                Tm  for TB transmission
                TBtr_init for TB treatment initiation (depending on treatment matrices defined in XML input file)
                HIVp for HIV progression
                HIVtr_* for HIV treatment 
                HIVXi for HIV incidence 
                
flow            in, out 

The years for which output is generated and the age groups are specified in the XML input file:

<output>
    <detailed.output years="(2000:2050)+0.5" age.group.lower.limits="0,15"/>
</output>

The reader is encouraged to study the ouput format in Excel using the filter function from 'Sort and Filter'.

The output format of the additional output files [population], [TBHIV_X], [frdTBHIV_X] and [frdpopadj], is documented in readme.txt
